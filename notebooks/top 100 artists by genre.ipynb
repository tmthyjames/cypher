Young niggas be brave And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave, From the cradle to the grave. From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy Living in the ghetto. From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say I made it this far. Many G's died hard And all they got was their name here up on a wall. It's sad thinkin' about the times Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land... As the warzone I got no home Don't have no friends neither. It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina. I keeps her wherever I go, I love my hoe. Never leave home without my sugar. I'm hafta plug a nigga. Mama told me not to trust no punks, And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me. Since then I been known. Sometimes I think my own self stupid 'Cause I stay shootin' at marks, Get twisted up in police reports. Since the cradle, I've been ungreatful. My first toy was a gun I got sprung and learn to love weapons. But now I'm through with money And through with street fame. Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave. From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy Living in the ghetto. From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy Living in the ghetto. March 18th A rainy day my mama gave birth To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth. From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb. Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum. I tried to cope loc But my family's broke And my pocket's short So now I gotta sling dope. In a game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame, The white man got a motha fucka slingin' cane. So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on. Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks. This shit don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops. I never flip flop Hear my glock cock Thug till I drop. And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times. It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt, But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work. From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy Living in the ghetto. From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy Living in the ghetto. Time's movin' fast Will I last another day? So I pray and I lay with my A.K. Did I sell my soul as a young kid? All the things I did Wishin' someone help me But they never did. I can't take it Will I make it to my older age? Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage. Lord help me, guide me, save me! Cause that's the way my Daddy raised me Crazy. Do or die. Nigga pull the triggah don't give a fuck. You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked. Nobody cares, it's me against the world. Keepin' murdah on my mind and my tech-9. I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die? I get high Then my mission is a walk-by. You better jet when I hit your set 'cause I'm commin'. Start runnin' yellin' evil mind as I'm gunnin'. One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside, For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died. The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave? So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave. Chorus till fade\n",

       "188\tJohnny Cash\tThe Johnny Cash Show (1970)\t1970\tHere Was a Man\t(Joy to the world the Lord is come)  Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant woman  He grew up in another small village  Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter  Then for three years he was a traveling minister  But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born  And where he did go he usually walked  He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home  Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big city  Yes here was a man  Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness  He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world  Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world  While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him  Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him  One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies  Then he went through the mockery of a trial  And was nailed to a cross between two thieves  And even while he was dying his executioners gambled  For the only piece of property that he had in this world  And that was his robe his purple robe  When he was dead he was taken down from the cross  And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends  More than nineteen centuries have come and gone  And today he's a centerpiece of the human race  Our leader in the column to human destiny  I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever marched All of the navies that ever sailed the seas  All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever reigned  All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth  So powerfully as that one solitary life  Here was a man (joy to the world the Lord is come)\n",

It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned, A sun that is the source of all our power. The Sun and you and me  And all the stars that we can see Are moving at a million miles a day. In an outer spiral orb, at 40,000 miles an hour, Of the Galaxy we call the Milky Way. Our Galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars. It's a 100,000 light years side to side It bulges in the middle 16,000 light years thick, But out by us it's just 3,000 light years wide. We're 30,000 light years from galactic central point. We go round every 200,000,000 years. And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions In this amazing and expanding Universe. --- Instrumental --- Our Universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding In all of the directions it can whiz As fast as it can go, the speed of light you know, 12,000,000 miles a minute,  And that's the fastest speed there is! So, remember when you're feeling very small and insecure How amazingly unlikely is your birth. And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space, 'Cause I'm afraid that we've been cheated here on Earth.\n",

Course: Now let us, Have a little talk with Jesus, Let us, tell Him all about our troubles, He will, Hear our faintest cry, And He will, answer by and by; Now when you, Feel a little party'r wheel turning, And you, know a little fire is burning. You will, Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right. Sometimes my path seems drear, without a ray of cheer, And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day; The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies, Ut Just a little talk with Jesus clears the way. I may have doubts and fears, my eyes be filled with tears, But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night; I go to m in prayer, He knows my every care, And Just a little talk with Jesus makes it right.\n",

have some company to lend Pull off to the side, let that old man have a ride He can tell you all the crazy things he\\'s seen I\\'m an old hitchhiker The highway is the only home I know Where you\\'re headed I don\\'t mind, I ain\\'t been there in some time And it\\'s just exactly where I want to go I can tell you how I started in the circus as a barker Drawin\\' people in from far and wide They never did regret the dollar that it cost \\'em We always left \\'em feelin\\' good inside We were headed for Montana when we hired us a dancer Her beauty it was more than I can say Then one summer night she set my soul on fire Lord, I wish that she was here with me today I\\'m an old hitchhiker I wonder what\\'s a waitin\\' \\'round the bend I don\\'t know what I might see, I don\\'t need no guarantee Just a ride from here to there and back again I was only seventeen when I took the open highway Took it for my teacher and a friend I\\'ve been thirty years a-thumbin\\', Some might call it bummin\\' But it\\'s better than just cryin\\' in the wind If you\\'re drivin\\' down the road and you come across an old man Holdin\\' out his thumb in the rain You can pull off to the side let the poor boy have a ride He can tell you all the crazy things he\\'s seen I\\'m an old hitchhiker Lookin\\' for the far side of the hill Some people say I\\'ll settle down, build a home in some small town

Now before you walk in the door Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer You'd better think of the consequence (But who are you?) I'm your motherfuckin' conscience. That's nonsense.

Try to pull each others legs, until the other begs, Were lying to ourselves That's the beauty of it, yeah 'Cause we truly love each other That's why we always fight, And all we do is shove each other Every other fuckin' night And its clear, it ain't gonna change This pin up rage, we both have, And we both feel like we've been upstaged By someone else, we've both been someone else With someone else The problem is, neither one wont tell It's an addiction, and it can't be fixed Our familys mixed up There's baby sister in the mix And it hurts, 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit And anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time, On every song, every lyric and every rhyme, All the hoop-lah, all of the whoopty woo, What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-doo But I won't be made a fool of, If this is true love, you wouldn't do what you did last time, You wouldn't screw up this time, 'Cause this time, girl I'm telling you what, You do it again I'm fucking you up, No matter what What you say, what you do, Ima hunt you down till I find you No matter where you run I'll be right there, right behind you And in your nightmares I surround you. I buy you flowers, and candy All the times that you threw them back at me Told me you hate me You gonna hate me more When you find out, You can't escape me whorrrre The more you, put me through The more it makes me wanna come back to you You say you hate me, I just love you more. You don't want me, I just want you more. I buy you flowers You throw them at me I know its sad but its making me happy. The more that you slap me, The more that it turns me on, 'Cause you love me And I love you more.\n",
       "164\tEminem\tEdit\tI Remember\tYa mother... fuckin' faggot. Hey yo... this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Schrody. Rest in peace. We'll never forget about you... fuckin' homo. We'll still remember. There once was a man who liked to jump around. (jump around) (yo) But he got too old to jump up and down. (up and down) (so then what happened?) So he put the mic down and picked a guitar up. (picked a guitar up) (and then he what?) Started singin' the blues like there was no tomorrow. (no tomorrow) (come on) Left his boys in the House of Pain. (in the House of Pain) (biach) It was the wisest decision he ever made. (ever made) But the dumbest thing that he could ever do. (he could ever do) (was what?) Was try ta buck a 380 on those that act shady Tell me now whatchu gonna do? (now whatchu gonna do?) (haha) 'Cause I remember all those years (yeah) How it was when you were here (c'mon) I remember how it was (what) How it was when you were young (yeah) Yesterday was so long ago (long ago) Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more. I remember back when you had the knack. (had the knack) (hahahahaha) And I remember when you had your first heart attack. (heart attack) (*wheezing noise) I was right there laughin' when I heard the news. (heard the news) I just wish the cardiac would've murdered you. (would've murdered you) (damn) Maybe Ice T's right, you are a bitch. (you are a bitch) (maybe he's right) You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich (leave when you're rich) (haha) But the dumbest thing you could ever do (that you could ever do) (was what?) Was try ta buck a 380 on those that act shady Tell me now whatchu gonna do? (now whatchu gonna do?) 'Cause I remember all those years. (what?) How it was when you were here. (come on) I remember how it was. (what?) How it was when you were young. Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago) Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more. (Yo yo yo yo yo yo) Remember back in '94, Like right before Miss Everlast was Whitey Ford, Before his heart attack had him on life support. (beep beep) When House of Pain was out of fame, Like someone doused the flame, And they became destined to never jump around again. Or even further back, when I first had heard the knack, When you were down with syndicate. I went to get the shit, man I was into it. But then you went, and took your style, and switched the shit. Now you sound ridiculous. You dickless piece of shit, how could you diss me bitch? (huh?) I liked you, thought you was all right for a white dude. Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you, Started rhymin' then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'. Like you mad that someone else was white and tryin' ta rhyme or somethin'. I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin' ta steal your light or nothin'. But you're a homosexual, white rappin' Irish (unknown) Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a (unknown) too. Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do. What's up witchu? I never fucked witchu, why would you fuck with me? Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what? Is you nuts as me? Plus I can sing better than you, and I don't fuckin' sing. And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string. But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you. I'm what you used to be; shit, you was me in '92. So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you. And maybe that'll help me know what it's like to sing the blues. (La-di-da) 'Cause I remember all those years. How it was when you were here. (I know) I remember how it was. (how it was) How it was when you were young. (when you were young) Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago) Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more. 'Cause I remember all those years. (what) How it was when you were here. (come on) I remember how it was. (how it was) How it was when you were young. Yesterday was so long ago. (long ago) Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more. Fuckin' homo (pussy) Fuckin' faggot sissy (fuck) And by the way, 380's a fuckin' sissy gun. (homo) You gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun. (don't fuck wit me) Little bitch. Next time say my fuckin' name in the song. Don't be subliminal about it. (you know) You gonna diss me, fuckin' diss me, fuckin' faggot. Fuckin' punk pussy. Fuckin' little bitch. Fuckin' cunt. Little fuckin'...fuck.\n",

Life is like a big obstacle, in front of your optic wanna slow you down, An every time you think you've gotten past it it's gonna come back, Around and tackle you to the damn ground, What are friends, friends are people that you think are friends, But they really your enemies with secret identities, And disguises to hide they' true colours, so just when you think you close enough to be brothers, They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin', What is money, money is what makes a man act funny, Money is the root of all evil, Money'll make them same friends come back around, Swearin that they was always always down, But it's life... I'm tired of life, I'm tired of backstabbin' ass snakes with friendly grins, I'm tried of committin so many sins, Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of hennie wins, Tired of never havin' any ends Tired of havin' skinny friends so full on crack and many things, I'm tired of this DJ, playin' your shit when he spins, I'm tired of not havin' a deal, tired of havin' to deal with this bullshit without grabbin the steel, Tired of drowin in my sorrow, Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo, I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin shit an dartin off, I'm tired of jobs startin off at $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin off, Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough, Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk for this jerk breatin down my neck, Drivin' me beserk, I'm tired of using plastic silverwear Tired of workin at buildin square, Tired of not being a millionare, But if I had a million dollars I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alchoholics, If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on, While I'm on the jon, If I had a millions bucks, it wouldn't be enough, 'cause I'd still be out robbin armoured trucks, If I had one wish, I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss, I'm tired of being white trash, broke an always poor, Tired of taken pop bottles back to the party store, Tired of not havin' a phone, tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on, Tired of not drivin' a BM, tired of not workin at GM, tired of wantin to be him, Tired of not sleepin' without atylanol PM, Tired of not performin in a packed collessium, Tired of not bein on tour, Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore, After work in the back of a contour, I'm tired of fakin knots with a stack of ones, havin' a lack of funds, an resort back to guns, Tired of bein stared at, tired of wearin the same damn nike air-hat, Tired of steppin in clubs wearin the same pair of luggs, Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin me rappin' bout drugs, Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me sayin' they wasn't feelin' me or no-bodies as ill as me, And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs tired of J.L.B. sayin' we're hip hop lib's, But if I had a million dollars I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alchoholics, If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on, While I'm on the john, If I had a millions bucks, it wouldn't be enough, 'cause I'd still be out robbin armoured trucks, If I had one wish, I would ask for one big enough ass for the whole world to kiss, You know what I'm sayin'? I'm tired of all of this bullshit, Tellin' me to be positive, how am I supposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive, You know what I'm sayin'? I rapp about shit around me, shit I see, You know what I'm sayin'? And right now I'm tired of everything, Tired of all this, player hating that's going on in my own city, You can't get away or play, You know what I'm sayin', But hey, it's cool though, You know what I'm sayin'?

(Eminem) Only learn to take, our anger and our hate Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take There's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate To the point that he just breaks, snaps and that's all it takes You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes But we ain't Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays And a picture that he paints But in the midst of all this anger and this angst Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints But I know, that I will always continue to grow, As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow There will never be another me And that I can guarantee That's why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day The game will never be the same No matter how much fame or success they attain There will never be another me And no matter what they do There will never be another you You can search but you'll never find You can try to rewind time But in your hearts and your minds We will never die We are forever alive And we continue growing...

Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching And kids think beef is the only option Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on You think the industry is fun And no pity with guns And when your money is up That's when your enemies come So if he died and came back Would he try to save rap? We needing a change, the drama remains I spent my whole life, fighting myself That I can't win so I'm inviting some help And every now and then I take rights from left I'm still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt And that there is a fight in itself So I just pray and hope god Take a like to myself No matter how much I try (stay alive) I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride Heard frivolous beats, we past that I'm trying to keep some income coming in And collect on my ass cap The rappers in the game ain't changed And I finally realized that we not in the same game The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind And we continue growin'...

Now I got a faggot-ass rapper attacking me With this gangsta rap, like I'm not gonna battle, Dr Dre? The man wasn't done shit since NWA And gave Eazy-E AIDS. Don't make shoot night on your fat ass, You homofuck, you ain't the only one goin' platinum. Osama Bin Laden, keeping it gangsta, Fuck Dr Dre, I'm the Aftermath. Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before, People I used to know just don't know me no more And everywhere that I go, I got people I know, Who've got people they know, so I suggest you lay low. Oh Dr Dre look at you, you fool I use your own rap against you, and I'm better. Lick my balls, till they are dry, Sorry... come again. Things just ain't the same for Bin Laden, This planet hates me more than Michael Jackson, Hating on the Taliban for keeping me captive, Threatening to find my little cave and blast it, Now I've got to worry about this wannabe gansta, Who pays other rappers to write his wack shit, Everyone knows that your beats are helped man, And you'll never blow by yourself man. Sorry, you'd blow... blow cocks, Use the hole as a straw and blow sperm out your nostrils. I don't give a hurried fuck, call Slim Shady, Snoop Dogg, D.O.C, Wren and Jay-Z, To write a verse, fuck I'll do it for ya, You still lick dick, this is Booshu Babara. Do you know who, do you know what, do you know who? Let's keep this between me and you. Osama... Osama... Oooosama... O-o-o-osama... Biatch.\n",

Even if I could, it'd all be grey, But you're picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, not so bad. (Eminem as Stan) Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'. I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom. I sent two letters back in autumn; you must not-a got 'em. There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'. Sometimes, I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em, But anyways, F- it. What's been up, man? How's you're daughter? My girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm about to be a father. If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie. I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too. I'm sorry. I had a friend kill himself over some chick who didn't want him. I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan. I even got the underground stuff you did with Scam. I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man. I like the stuff you did with Ruckus, too. That guy was fat. Anyways, I hope you get this, man. Hit me back, just to chat. Truly yours, your biggest fan. This is Stan. Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote. I hope you get a chance. I ain't mad. I just think it's SCREWED UP that you don't answer fans. If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew. He's my little brother, man. He's only six years old. We waited in the blistering cold for you. 4 hours and you just said \"\"No\"\". That's pretty crummy, man. You're like his favorite idol. He wants to be just like you, man. He likes you more than I do. I ain't that mad, though. I just don't like being lied to. Remember when we met back in Denver, you said if I write you You'd write back. See, I'm just like you in a way. I never knew my father, neither. He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her. I can relate to what you're saying in your songs, So when I have a crummy day, I drift away and put 'em on 'Cause I don't really got nothin' else So that stuff helps when I'm depressed. I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest. Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds. It's like adrenaline. The pain is such a sudden rush for me. See, everything you say is real, and I respect it cause you tell it. My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7, But she don't know you like I know you, Slim. No one does. She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up. You gotta call me, man. I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. Sincerely yours, Stan P.S. We should be together, too. Dear Mr I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans, This'll be the last package I ever send your @$$. It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters. I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect. So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway. Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka. You dare me to drive? You know that song by Phil Collins, \"\"In the Air of the Night\"\" About that guy that coulda saved that other guy from drowning, But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then later at a show he found 'em? That's kinda how this is. You coulda saved me from drowning. Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers, now. I'm drowsy' and all I wanted was a lousy Letter or a call. I hope you know I ripped ALL you're pictures off the wall. I love you, Slim. We coulda been together; think about it. You've ruined it, now. I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it. I hope you're conscience EATS at you and you can't BREATHE without me! See Slim,(backround screaming) Shut up, slut! I'm tryin' to talk! Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk, But I didn't slit her throat. I just tied her up. See I ain't like you 'cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, then she'll die too. Well, gotta go. I'm almost at the bridge, now. Oh shoot, I forgot. How'm I supposed to send this tape out?! (Car tires squeal, CRASH, a brief silence, A LOUD splash) (Eminem as Slim Shady) Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy You said you're girlfriend's pregnant, now. How far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you'd call you're daughter that. And here's an autograph for Matthew. I wrote it on the Starter cap. I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show. I musta missed you. Don't think I did that stuff intenionally just to diss you. But what's this you said about you like to cut you're wrists, too? I say that stuff just clownin', dogg. C'mon, how messed up is you? You got some issues, Stan. I think you need some councelin' To help your butt from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some. And what's this about us meant to be together? That type of junk will make me not want us to meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself. I think you'll be doin' just fine If you relax a little. I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan, Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy stuff. I saw this one thing on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid. And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to. Come to think about it. His name was... It was you. DAMN!\"\n",

       "275\tEminem\tEdit\tThe Night Before Christmas\t\"Hey, Dave, 'twas the night before Christmas we'll go! Hi, boys, here I go! 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; One, two, three, four, no, Dave, don't we wanna hear some more! The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads; And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, Had settled our heads for a long winter's nap, When out on the lawn there a rose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon outside was shining on the snow When the look will right on the ground below, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer, With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More faster than eagles the reindeer came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name; \"\"Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!\"\" And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my hand, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His cute little mouth was just like a bow, And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook, like a bowlful of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, \"\"Merry Christmas to all, and good-night.\"\"\"\n",

Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching And kids think beef is the only option Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on You think the industry is fun And no pity with guns And when your money is up That's when your enemies come So if he died and came back Would he try to save rap? We needing a change, the drama remains I spent my whole life, fighting myself That I can't win so I'm inviting some help And every now and then I take rights from left I'm still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt And that there is a fight in itself So I just pray and hope god Take a like to myself No matter how much I try (stay alive) I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride Heard frivolous beats, we past that I'm trying to keep some income coming in And collect on my ass cap The rappers in the game ain't changed And I finally realized that we not in the same game The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind And we continue growin'...

You didn't pray for me when I was local And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you At least, a thousand times in these rhymes I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it? Just watchin it from a opposite standpoint, man boy it's got to look Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of Right now on how, to describe the shit This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it Just watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit So be careful what you wish forrrr Cause you just might get it, and if you get it Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld I said be careful what you wish forrrr Cause you just might get it, and if you get it Then you just might not knowwww what to do wit it Cause it might just come back on you ten-folllld\"\n",

Yo left, yo left, yo left right left Yo left, yo left, yo left right left Yo left, yo left, yo left right left Yo left, yo left, yo left right left Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them 'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem. Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop. Amoxacilin is just not real enough. The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners. You're coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us. You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up. For sizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.

This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again. So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end. 'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in. I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in. It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me. But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me. That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me. Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me. You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me. Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth. Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps. I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.

I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first. 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse. That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.

But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leanin' on me 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me My baby girl, keeps gettin' older I watch her grow up with pride People make jokes, 'cause they don't understand me They just don't see my real side I act like shit don't phase me, inside it drives me crazy My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leanin' on me 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me Man if I could sing I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her God I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't want her Now you probably get this picture from my public persona That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his mama But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest 'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul And just know that I grow colder the older I grow This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold And this load is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin' Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt So many chances, man it's too bad, coulda had someone else But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facin': 3 felonies, 6 years of probation I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman Man I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't've ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin' But fuck it it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leanin'on me 'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier Nothin' can take her from me Woo!

For the laughter, sing for the tears (Sing with me!) Sing it with me, if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus But music is reflection of self, we just explain it And then we get our checks in the mail, it's fucked up ain't it How we can come from practically nothing To being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives Till they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die Till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can Sing with me,   for the year  For the laughter, sing for the tears  Sing it with me, if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Sing with me,   for the year  For the laughter, sing for the tears  Sing it with me, if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n",

take you and I, to a place that you can\\'t see But I believe you can fly I don\\'t mean nobody harm, I\\'m just partyin\\' I\\'m not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian Just the man who\\'s on the mic So let me, entertain you My, music can be slightly amusing You shouldn\\'t take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing Trying to separate the truth from entertainment It\\'s stupid ain\\'t it, I get sick of trying to explain it See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde \\'Cause I came here to uplift let your woes be gone Tell em\\' to get fucked and just mosey on Constantly movin\\', constantly using the constitution As a form of restitution Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant Let me entertain you like  I\\'ll be here when y\\'all are gone rebuilding World revolving, still evolving, still Slim How many kids will copy, probably millions But I\\'ma do this as a fuckin\\' hobby till then cause I\\'m only entertaining you, my Goal is to stimulate making you high And take you and I, to a place that you can\\'t see But I believe you can fly I don\\'t mean nobody harm, I\\'m just partyin\\' I\\'m not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian Just the man who\\'s on the mic So let me, entertain you My, lyrical content contains subject matter That sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an Alarmin\\' rate, common denominate Add it up and you\\'ll see that\\'s why I dominate I try to stimulate, but kids emulate And mimic every move you make, Slim you\\'re great But wait, can\\'t you see I\\'m only here to entertain I gotta be the one to go against the grain \\'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it but it\\'s inhumane For me to see you be influenced, and pretend you ain\\'t But they don\\'t understand that I\\'ve been through pain If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain But you can\\'t just stand there and try to judge It hurts, but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much And it\\'s such a pleasure every button that I touch I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but I\\'m only entertaining you, my Goal is to stimulate making you high And take you and I, to a place that you can\\'t see But I believe you can fly I don\\'t mean nobody harm, I\\'m just partyin\\' I\\'m not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian Just the man who\\'s on the mic So let me, entertain you</td></tr><tr class=\"text-nowrap\"><td>37</td><td tabindex=\"1\" data-column=\"Eminem\">Eminem</td><td tabindex=\"1\" data-column=\"Don\\'t Call Me Marshall (2003)\">Don\\'t Call

remained estranged and I hate it though, but I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far \\'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though \\'Cause you ain\\'t even get to witness your grandbabies grow But I\\'m sorry mama for \"Cleaning Out My Closet\", at the time I was angry Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, \\'cause Now I know it\\'s not your fault, and I\\'m not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it\\'s on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but Now the medication\\'s takin\\' over and your mental state\\'s deteriorating slow And I\\'m way too old to cry, the shit is painful though But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, \\'cause One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But I\\'dve flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas Someone ever moved them from me, that you could\\'ve bet your asses If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap \\'em And although one has only met their grandma Once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this, overwhelming sadness come over me As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and I saw your headlights as I looked back And I\\'m mad I didn\\'t get the chance to Thank you for being my Mom and my Dad So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to lay it \\'fore I\\'m dead The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we\\'re crashing So if I\\'m not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I will always love you from afar \\'Cause you\\'re my ma I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life (start over) One without a cause (clean slate) So I\\'m coming home tonight Well no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down Or if the crew can\\'t wake me up Well just know that I\\'m alright I was not afraid to die Oh, even if there\\'s songs to sing Well my children will carry me Just know that I\\'m alright I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my new girl So I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I\\'m alright I am not afraid to die I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life</td></tr><tr class=\"text-nowrap\"><td>531</td><td tabindex=\"1\"
